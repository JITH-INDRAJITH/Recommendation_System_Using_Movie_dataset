# Recommendation_System_Using_Movie_dataset
This repository contains the source code and resources for building a recommendation system using movie datasets. The datasets used in this project include:
credits.csv: This dataset contains information about movie credits, including cast and crew members. It typically includes columns such as movie ID, cast, crew, and other relevant metadata.
movies.csv: This dataset contains information about movies, such as title, genre, release year, and other attributes. It serves as the primary source of movie data for building the recommendation system.
## Key Features:
Data Processing: The repository includes scripts and notebooks for processing movie datasets, including data cleaning, exploration, and feature engineering.
Recommendation Algorithms: Implementations of various recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluation scripts to measure the performance of recommendation algorithms using standard evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean squared error (MSE).
Model Deployment: Guides and examples for deploying recommendation models in production environments, including web applications and APIs.
## Usage:
Clone the repository and explore the provided notebooks and scripts to understand the recommendation system implementation.
Use the provided datasets (credits.csv and movies.csv) or replace them with your own data to build custom recommendation models tailored to your application.
## Contributing:
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, new features, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
